# Lottery-Contract
This Solidity lottery contract lets users join by sending exactly 2 Ether. A manager oversees the process. When at least three participants enter, the manager triggers a winner selection. One random winner gets the total Ether balance, and the contract resets for the next round. A fair, decentralized way to run lottery draws on Ethereum.
